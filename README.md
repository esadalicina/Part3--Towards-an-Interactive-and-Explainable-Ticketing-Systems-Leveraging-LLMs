# Master Thesis Part 2: Towards an Interactive and Explainable Ticketing System Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)

This is a Ticketing System web application built using Streamlit. It is the second part of my Master's Thesis Project, focusing on implementing a complete ticketing management solution with a explainable and interactive user-friendly interface. The application allows users to create, manage, and track tickets, handle user roles (Admin/User/Support Staf), and offers real-time ticket management.

Master Thesis Part 1 - This repository involves preprocessing the dataset for the ticketing system to improve ticket classification through the evaluation and comparison of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models:
