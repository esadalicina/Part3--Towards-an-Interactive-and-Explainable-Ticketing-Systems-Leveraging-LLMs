# Master Thesis Part 3: Towards an Interactive and Explainable Ticketing System Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository presents the third part of my thesis, introducing a novel approach to ticketing systems by integrating a Discord-based community with task-specific bots (such as ticket handling, a chatbot, and a voting bot). The proposed system leverages the open-source capabilities of the Discord platform to manage and process support requests directly within Discord channels, utilizing its real-time communication features and large community support. An initial evaluation of the system indicates that 88% of users are satisfied with the use of Discord, highlighting its potential to provide scalable solutions for various community-driven support scenarios. 

Master Thesis Part 1 - This repository involves preprocessing the dataset for the ticketing system to improve ticket classification through the evaluation and comparison of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models:
